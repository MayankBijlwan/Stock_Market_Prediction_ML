## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on predicting **stock market price trends** using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks** combined with **Sentiment Analysis of financial news**.  
The aim is to provide investors and analysts with a tool that improves decision-making by combining **historical stock data** with **real-time market sentiment**.  

It is deployed as a **Flask web application** where users can input stock symbols and view predicted stock trends with interactive visualizations.

## ✨ Features  
- ✅ Predicts stock price movement using **LSTM RNN models**.  
- ✅ Achieved **87% accuracy** on test datasets (NSE/BSE historical data).  
- ✅ Integrated **news sentiment analysis**, improving reliability by **15%**.  
- ✅ Handles **large datasets (100K+ rows)** with optimized preprocessing.  
- ✅ Deployed as a **Flask web app** with real-time graph visualization.  
- ✅ User-friendly UI: enter stock symbol → get predictions instantly.
